# Project-Spanish-Vector
Using Anki Vector SDK i've made this project where:
-Vector understand when you talk it in spanish
-He can search in wikipedia people, things, activities, places ...
-He can talk with you reasonably thanks to a chatbot with IA
-He can go to his home and come back



If you want to see only the Vector's code you have to look into chatbot.py document.
